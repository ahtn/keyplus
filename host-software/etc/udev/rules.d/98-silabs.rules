# This is a udev rules file for all USB devices with a Silicon Labs Vendor ID
# except those Silabs JLink devices. 
# The Vendor IDs supported are (add more as needed): 
#    0x10c4    (for c8051 and USBXpress devices)
#
# This file is based on the sample udev file from HIDAPI (using libusb-1.0).
#
# NOTE: This udev file will grant read and write access to ALL users,
# include non-privileged users, for ALL USB devices that have a matching
# Vendor ID according to the rules below. If this is not desirable and you
# would like to put more restrictions on access to these devices, then read
# http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html for more information.

# This is a sample udev file for HIDAPI devices which changes the permissions
# to 0666 (world readable/writable) for a specified device on Linux systems.

# If you are using the libusb implementation of hidapi (hid-libusb.c), then
# use something like the following line, substituting the VID and PID with
# those of your device. Note that for kernels before 2.6.24, you will need
# to substitute "usb" with "usb_device". It shouldn't hurt to use two lines
# (one each way) for compatibility with older systems.

# HIDAPI/libusb
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", MODE="0666"

# Once done, optionally rename this file for your device, and drop it into
# /etc/udev/rules.d and unplug and re-plug your device. This is all that is
# necessary to see the new permissions. Udev does not have to be restarted.

# If you think permissions of 0666 are too loose, then see:
# http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html for more information on finer
# grained permission setting. For example, it might be sufficient to just
# set the group or user owner for specific devices (for example the plugdev
# group on some systems).
